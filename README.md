# Grpc-spring
This project provides a simple implementation for introducing gRPC technology and understanding unary calls.

## Testing 
You can use either BloomRPC or other applications.
For BloomRPC, first add the demo.proto file in the following directory.

```
spring-grpc-demo\common\src\main\proto\demo.proto
```

Then, enter the address of your gRPC server. 
We are using port 9090 by default.

```
localhost:9090
```

Result:
